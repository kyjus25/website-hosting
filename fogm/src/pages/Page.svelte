        <p>üí≤ell.to was created in 2021 while I was looking for a new job during the pandemic that just will not end. I heard about another auction site saying that they would not allow particular legal items to be sold and I thought that just is not right. If I am legally allowed to own that item and legally allowed to sell that item to anyone else in the United States, then by what authority did they have to deny that sale? Any now here we are.</p>
        
        <p>To address the domain name as well, üí≤ell.to is the exact same as xn--ell-ke23b.to and that is because not all web browsers, social media sites or chat apps can display them properly yet. Even though the first domain with an emoji was purchased in 2004 due to the lack of support on the desktop, these domains are not very common. More information can be found on <a href="https://i‚ù§Ô∏è.ws" target="_blank">i‚ù§Ô∏è.ws</a>.</p>

        <p>There are only a few rules I have about the sales.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Everything you sell must be yours to sell.</li>
            <li>It must be legal to sell that item to anyone across state borders.</li>
            <li>You must pay for the items you won, all sales are final.</li>
            <li>Fees: There are no fees to list an item. Once the item sells, there is a 10% final fee.</li>
        </ul>
