![](https://fireofgodministries-thefathershouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/poor_0.jpg)Jesus spoke the words to go into all the world and make Disciples and comes with a cost both physicaly and monetarely. These words are true and it is not enough to just make converts but they must be shaped, molded and trained so they can make more Disciples. We Believe in the training up of men and women of God to do the end time Harvest with Power. We Believe in a Gospel Of Power and that Power came on Pentecost. To be effective Ministers we Believe the Holy Spirit is a necessity in the process of becoming a Disciple just like in the early church.

Matt 28:18-20 _And Jesus came up and spoke to them saying,” All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.     19 ”    Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing    them in the name of the Father and the Son_

_and the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all that    I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end    of the age_.”    NASU

We Believe our mission and calling is more focused, so we make great efforts to [Obey](https://youtu.be/2B9BfWjKcy0) other scripture that tells us to go to the poor and the orphans and widows and those who are imprisoned. We are making an Army Of Ministers, to    win the lost all over the world out of the very same people the modern church has turned its back on.

Matt 11:4-6  _Jesus answered and said to them, “Go and report to John what you hear and see:  5 the BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM.  6 “And blessed is he who does not take offense at Me.”_     NASU

Jesus spoke these words and we feel it is our calling to respond. This path is not glamorous and is not filled with big beautiful churches but in the end there will be many crowns of righteousness. We do not look for our own comfort life first but Believe we are to show Christ to the world. We Believe in a strong evangelism ministry even in the poor areas that no one wants to go. This is why this next verse is so very important.

Luke 4:18-19 _A THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME, BECAUSE HE ANOINTED ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR . HE HAS SENT ME TO PROCLAIM RELEASE TO THE CAPTIVES, AND RECOVERY OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND, TO SET FREE THOSE WHO ARE OPPRESSED,  19 TO PROCLAIM THE FAVORABLE YEAR OF THE LORD.”_  NASU

Jesus set His life apart fully for God and gave that very life so others could have life. We are to set ourselves apart inorder bring Hope to the Hopeless and Life to the dyeing.

We look at examples set and the simple commands to see how we must Minister. Our mission is Obedience and to do the Will of the Father. What is the Fathers Will?

Luke 14:12-14 And He also went on to say to the one who had invited Him, “When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, otherwise they may also invite you in return and that will be your repayment.  13 “But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,  14 and you will be blessed, since they do not have the means to repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”  NASU

![bride, bride in white, wedding, feast, bible, marrage supper, lamb of god](https://fireofgodministries-thefathershouse.com/admin/uploads/MarriageSupper.jpg)We must invite many to the wedding feast and we are given instruction to those whom we must invite. We are not looking for pats on the back from man or from people who can repay or bless us. We go to the very poor areas and serve them life. We are filled and led by the Holy Spirit and God prepares the way. This creates a great blessing because we know God is watching over us and we want our lives pleasing unto Him.

In our churches we keep these next verses in mind. It is our will to please God and not man. This has resulted in our Ministry being very different from the rest but we pray that many eyes open and change.

James 2:1-7 _My brethren, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism. 2 For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in dirty clothes, 3 and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes, and say, “You sit here in a good_

_place,” and you say to the poor man, “You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool,” 4 have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives? 5 Listen, my beloved brethren: did not God choose the poor of this world to be  rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him? 6 But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you and personally drag you into court? 7 Do they not blaspheme the fair name by which you have been called?_   NASU

The early church did things much different than the church today and our Mission is to return to the ways of the early church in the book of Acts but also to gather the end time harvst in the End Time Power.
