## Why are we here?

Since the beginning of time, man has looked to the skies wondering _if there is a God_. _Is there a higher power_, a _creator_?  Many ask:  _Why am I here_? They have dug into science to find out. _ **Many**_ just want to believe there is not a God in order to _maintain a stance of importance and self reliance_. Man by default yearns to hold things dear and History shows that the natural man looks to the heavens or to the things of earth to worship. The natural man has an inert desire to worship something.

## Religions Of The World

Some religions believe in many gods while others believe in earthly worship.   There are those who believe there is one creator and He is worthy of worship. _It is that God we at Fire of God Ministries represent_.  Even to those who believe that there is only one True God, He still seems to be a_ **mystery**._ He seems to be _unknown_ or _mysterious_ and quiet but I ask: is that who he really is? ** _Every religion and atheist alike seem to have a hole or a void that isn’t being filled._**

Many churches today teach a lascivious grace and say all things are permissible, even lawlessness (Hebrews 10: 28-30) …or they teach an incomplete grace and have a form of Holiness and do not experience its  Transforming Power (2 Tim 3:4-5) and then self justify the situation..

These two groups are some of the first to reject truth when brought to them and not listen to Biblical warning and desire to hold fast to traditional teachings(Luke 10:16.) The one who listens to you (my servant) listens to Me, and the one who rejects you( The Servant), rejects Me; and he who rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me.”

_**Why**_ is the creator of the universe and everything in it so unknown even to most Christians? Why is the part of God that dwells on the earth at any point in time also the most misunderstood part of God.  That part of the God family that is on the earth now is called the revelator or comforter…the Holy Spirit.

## We here at Fire Of God Ministries want to help make Him known.

[We are here](https://fireofgodministries-thefathershouse.com/?page=Mission%20Statement) to restore the Jesus of the Bible and to raise up a generation of disciples walking in the book of acts like the disciples Jesus trained. Jesus commanded his [disciples](https://fireofgodministries-thefathershouse.com/?page=Bible%20Study%20And%20Stories) to go into all the earth and these signs shall follow those who believe.  Mark 16:16-18 states:”He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved; but he who has disbelieved shall be condemned.These signs will accompany those who have believed: in My name they will cast out demons, they will speak with new tongues; they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.” They will walk out psalms 91.

It is that simple.  The fruit of the Believer is Unwavering Faith and the fruit displayed of the spirit thats in Galatians 5\. That’s Gods manifest Glory in there lives. We believe the Bible when it says to take up your cross and lay down your will in order to do the will of the Father.  We are to be  led by the Holy Spirit in order to be Christ to the world. The Bible says ‘if they have seen me, they have seen the Father’. We believe we are to represent Jesus to the world today.

## Jesus’ command was for his disciples to go represent him as He showed them.

We Teach and Preach [Holiness](https://fireofgodministries-thefathershouse.com/2017/06/06/the-sandbox/).(Both Holiness established threw Jesus Christ But also Holiess brought by obedience to Sanctification.)  As he said, be ye Holy as I am Holy 1 Peter 1:16\. The bible also says in Hebrews 12:14 without holiness no one will see the Lord.

We have begun to [teach classes(](https://fireofgodministries-thefathershouse.com/the-fathers-house/brazil-ministry/jump-start-english/)The Fathers House) in other nations to help make the body one, starting with an English class in Brazil. We are here to teach, train and send others out with the gifts of the Holy Spirit as their ally. We do the same in prison ministries and teen challenge in the U.S.A and other countries but we also go to third world counties and to the homeless and into places most won’t go. We go where the Lord leads us and expect Him to keep His Word to Empower us to walk out every situation even unto death like the early church and the disciples.

We are here at fire of God ministries to [help you grow](https://fireofgodministries-thefathershouse.com/bible-based-sermon-videos/bible-study-stories/) in what God has in store for you.   We will help you as God equips you with the sword of the word and you will learn to use the Holy Spirit  through continued Obedience to Him as your relationship with God grows.

These things will help you walk in truth and light but also with the Discernment needed for the times we live.  This Discernment will help you finish the race strong and also with the Faith and a walk that pleases God. We want you to hear also on that great day:  
“Well done my good and faithful servant!”

You are welcome in The Fathers House, come sit at my table!
