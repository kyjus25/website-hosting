# **The Fathers House is the church name of Fire Of God Ministries but more importantly is the house God is building.**

# **In my Father’s house are many mansions John 14:2 John 14:1-4**

**14 1 “Don’t let yourselves be disturbed. Trust in God and trust in me. 2 In my Father’s house are many places to live. If there weren’t, I would have told you; because I am going there to prepare a place for you. 3 Since I am going and preparing a place for you, I will return to take you with me; so that where I am, you may be also. 4 Furthermore, you know where I’m going; and you know the way there.”**

**I thought it would be interesting to use the complete Jewish Bible because of how it is worded.**

## **Trouble on the heart line!**

** Many today associate the word  “mansions” with a home or a living space and it is but it is actually about the home of our heart and the living space in our hearts for God.    We are the mansions made by the indwelling of the Spirit of the living God.  We are a new creation. The Father’s house is the righteous bride in white that the Master and King is coming back for.  They are Kings and Priest of the royal priesthood.  They will meet him in the air and be part of the great could of witnesses. We ( the mansions, the building blocks, the living stones) make up the New Jerusalem that will be established on the earth (and not in heaven as many teach and believe.)**

### **[A New Heaven and a New Earth](http://biblehub.com/revelation/21.htm)  
[1](http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm)Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea. [2](http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm)And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband. [3](http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm)And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them,…**

**So many people take their body (the tabernacle) lightly and mix it with pagan tradition and idolatry like a harlot who rents her body out for money. ( Isaiah 2: 6-10, Zephaniah 1: 4-8) They mix eastern mythology and humanism (psychology) to make a teaching that is pleasing to the ears and an easy path. Instead of rising up to Gods level, they bring him out of heaven to their level. If it gets tough then we just water down teaching and lower god a little further to suit our wants.  It’s no wonder God is unknown and is attacked at His return. It’s no wonder his wrath is poured out because he warned us to not do these things and what would happen if we did. Justice will be served for the foolish virgins or the foolish harlots.**

**The Fathers House is not about walls and religion.  It’s about making it on earth as it is in heaven. It’s about training and [teaching](https://fireofgodministries-thefathershouse.com/?page=Bible%20Based%20Sermon%20Videos) Holiness (sanctification) and being righteous in the sight of God. for without holiness, none will ever see God. (Hebrews 4:13 ) It’s making holy temples by the blood of the lamb that refuse to trample the cross and walk out holiness in their lives.  It’s making hearts of flesh that can be molded instead of hardened hearts of stone.  It is being approved by God instead of being spit out like a fountain of lukewarm water from his mouth.  Not the fate of those in Hebrews 9:27-31**

**Rev 17:3-6**

**3 And [the angel] bore me away [rapt] in the Spirit into a desert (wilderness), and I saw a woman seated on a scarlet beast that was all covered with blasphemous titles (names), and he had seven heads and ten horns. 4 The woman was robed in purple and scarlet and bedecked with gold, precious stones, and pearls, [and she was] holding in her hand a golden cup full of the accursed offenses and the filth of her lewdness and vice.  [Jer 51:7.] 5 And on her forehead there was inscribed a name of mystery [with a secret symbolic meaning]: Babylon the great, the mother of prostitutes (idolatresses) and of the filth and atrocities and abominations of the earth. 6 I also saw that the woman was drunk, [drunk] with the blood of the saints (God’s people) and the blood of the martyrs [who witnessed] for Jesus. And when I saw her, I was utterly amazed and wondered greatly.**

**We are here at [Fire of God ministries-the Fathers House](https://fireofgodministries-thefathershouse.com/?page=Order) to [train](https://fireofgodministries-thefathershouse.com/?page=Bible%20Study%20And%20Stories) up disciples that are not blown around by every wind of doctrine and who will stand and fight for Jesus. A mighty Army that’s clothed in righteousness and the armor of light who is also wrapped in fine linen. That cost is our life and requires much prayer support and money to do that end time work.

**Revelation 3:13-18 13 He who can hear, let him listen to and heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). 14 And to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Laodicea write<u>: These are the words of the Amen ( THE SO BE IT)</u>, the trusty and faithful and true Witness, the Origin and Beginning and Author of God’s creation:  [Isa 55:4; Prov 8:22.]This is the logos, the word or Jesus speaking**

** 15 I know your [record of] works (our Fruit logged into the book of remembrance) and what you are doing; you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were cold or hot! 16 So, because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of My mouth! 17 For you say, I am rich; I have prospered and grown wealthy, and I am in need of nothing; and you do not realize and understand that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked.  [Hos 12:8.] 18 Therefore I counsel you to purchase from Me gold refined and tested by fire, ( THE 5 WISE VIRGINS) that you may be [truly] wealthy, and white clothes to clothe you and to keep the shame of your nudity from being seen, and salve to put on your eyes, that you may see.**

**Turn from the ways Adam and eve established in the garden. (free will) They wanted to decide good and evil which caused a separation between God and man.   God sent Jesus (before the foundations of the world was put in motion) to be the redeemer because of the Love of God to redeem man back to him. God wanted children to be pillars in His house, to be one with him and dwell with them so much that he had to send Jesus.**

** It was the only way to make the fathers house a mansion that could be filled with God’s love!**

**The fathers house is our home for eternity and we need eternal focus!**
